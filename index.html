        <h2>Powerlifting 🏋🏻‍♂️</h2>
        	<p>
        	One of my biggest passions is powerlifting, a sport I took very seriously during my final year of high school. I had a dedicated coach and followed a structured training program, which helped me achieve a solid level of performance. Competing in several events allowed me to push my limits and develop a strong sense of discipline. The training regimen, the focus on technique, and the constant pursuit of strength improvement taught me valuable lessons about perseverance and self-motivation that I still apply in my daily life.here is my SBD powerlifting belt

        <h2>Ice Skating ⛸️</h2>
          <p>
            Another sport that I recently picked up is ice skating, which I started in Strasbourg with a friend who had eight years of hockey experience. His guidance has been incredibly helpful in improving my technique and confidence on the ice. Unlike casual skating, I decided to take it seriously and even bought my own skates. I love the feeling of gliding effortlessly and progressively mastering new movements. Ice skating challenges my balance and coordination, making every session both fun and rewarding.Here are my hockey skates

        <h2>MMA 🥊</h2>
          <p>
            In addition, I discovered a deep passion for MMA (Mixed Martial Arts), which I began practicing during the second semester at the Institut de Combat in Lille. This sport fascinates me because it requires a mix of physical strength, technique, and strategy. Each training session pushes me out of my comfort zone, whether it’s grappling, striking, or conditioning. I appreciate the diversity of skills involved and the mental resilience it builds. MMA is not just about fighting—it’s about discipline, respect, and continuous self-improvement.here is my MMA mouthguard

        <h2>Downhill Bike 🚴🏻</h2>
          <p>
            Lastly, I have a strong passion for downhill mountain biking, which I practice every year in the mountains. I usually spend a week during holidays and ride at well-known bike parks such as La Bresse and Lac Blanc. The thrill of speeding down steep trails, maneuvering through technical sections, and hitting jumps gives me an incredible rush. The mix of adrenaline and breathtaking landscapes makes downhill biking one of my favorite activities. There's nothing quite like the feeling of soaring through the air after a big jump and landing smoothly on the trail, ready for the next challenge.and this is my full-suspension Giant mountain bike
